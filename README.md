This is a simple photo viewing application I had been hacking together a few months ago that I decided to host and pick up again. You can view the live demo [here] http://react-photos.herokuapp.com/ or run the project based on the instructions below.

Simple installation rundown:

from terminal
  git clone https://github.com/ccslakey/500px-react-pt-2.git
  cd 500px-react-pt-2
  npm install
  npm start
  go to localhost:3000 on your web browser

This was one of my first projects written in React. It's fairly simple for the time being but could use Redux for state management before adding more features. It uses React-Router for navigation, Superagent for AJAX calls, and React-Bootstrap for prestyled JSX components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find out how to perform common tasks related to create-react-app [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

Rough development roadmap

User Actions
POST to 500px
Customize bootstrap components and theme in general
Add in redux? - could help provide structure for adding in future features
