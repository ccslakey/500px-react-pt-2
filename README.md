This is a simple photo viewing application I had been hacking together a few months ago that I decided to host and pick up again. You can view the live demo [here](http://react-photos.herokuapp.com/) or run the project based on the instructions below.

Simple installation rundown:

from terminal
 
git clone https://github.com/ccslakey/500px-react-pt-2.git

cd 500px-react-pt-2

npm install

npm start

go to localhost:3000 on your web browser

This was one of my first projects written in [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/). It's fairly simple for the time being but could use Redux for state management before adding more features. It uses [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for navigation, [Superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) for AJAX calls, and [React-Bootstrap](http://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for prestyled JSX components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find out how to perform common tasks related to create-react-app [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

Development roadmap for the forseeable future

User Actions
POST to 500px
Customize bootstrap components and theme in general
Add in redux? - could help provide structure for adding in future features
